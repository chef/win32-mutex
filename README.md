# win32-mutex

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/win32-mutex.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/win32-mutex)

Interface for Mutexes on MS Windows.

## Prerequisites

- win32-ipc 0.6.0 or later

## Installation

```
gem install win32-mutex
```

## Synopsis

```ruby
require 'win32/mutex'

# Do not leave out the 'Win32::', otherwise you're using Ruby's Mutex class.
Win32::Mutex.new(false, 'test') do |m|
  # Do stuff
  m.release
end
```

## Documentation

The mutex.rb file contains inline RDoc documentation. If you installed this file as a gem, then you have the docs.

For an example of win32-mutex in action, look at the `example_win32_mutex.rb` file in the `examples` directory. You can also run the `example` rake task.

## Notes

The Mutex class is a subclass of `Win32::Ipc` (`win32-ipc`). This library requires the `win32-ipc` library internally. You don't need to explicitly call it.
