## Tooling & Ecosystem

- **Language**: Ruby
- **Build System**: Rake
- **Testing Framework**: Test::Unit (standard Ruby testing)
- **Linting**: RuboCop (Ruby style guide enforcement)
- **Package Manager**: RubyGems
- **Release Automation**: Chef Expeditor
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions + Chef's common workflows
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub

## Issue (Jira/Tracker) Integration

This repository uses Jira for issue tracking via the Atlassian MCP server. AI assistants MUST:

1. Use MCP tools to fetch Jira issues when provided with issue keys (e.g., `ABC-123`)
2. Parse Jira issue content for: summary, description, acceptance criteria, issue type, labels, story points
3. Reference Jira issue keys in commits and PRs using format `(ABC-123)`
4. Create implementation plans based on Jira issue requirements
5. Seek clarification if acceptance criteria are unclear or missing

**MCP Integration**: The repository is configured with `atlassian-mcp-server` for Jira connectivity via `.vscode/mcp.json`.

## Workflow Overview

AI assistants MUST follow these phases in order:

1. **Intake & Clarify** - Understand requirements and scope
2. **Repository Analysis** - Review existing code and dependencies  
3. **Plan Draft** - Create detailed implementation plan
4. **Plan Confirmation** - User approval gate (MUST respond "yes")
5. **Incremental Implementation** - Small, testable changes
6. **Lint / Style** - RuboCop compliance verification
7. **Test & Coverage Validation** - Ensure test coverage ≥80%
8. **DCO Commit** - Developer Certificate of Origin compliance
9. **Push & Draft PR Creation** - Create draft pull request
10. **Label & Risk Application** - Apply appropriate GitHub labels
11. **Final Validation** - Comprehensive review before completion

Each phase ends with: Step Summary + Checklist + "Continue to next step? (yes/no)".

## Detailed Step Instructions

AI assistants MUST adhere to these principles:

- **Smallest cohesive change per commit**
- **Add/adjust tests immediately with each behavior change**
- **Present a mapping of changes to tests before committing**

Example Step Output:
```
Step: Add boundary guard in parser
Summary: Added nil check & size constraint; tests added for empty input & overflow.
Checklist:
- [x] Plan
- [x] Implementation  
- [ ] Tests
Proceed? (yes/no)
```

If user responds other than explicit "yes" → AI MUST pause & clarify.

## Branching & PR Standards

- **Branch Naming**: Use GitHub issue number if available (e.g., `issue-123-fix-mutex-leak`), otherwise kebab-case slug ≤40 chars
- **One logical change set per branch** (MUST)
- **PR MUST remain draft** until: tests pass + lint/style pass + coverage mapping completed
- **Risk Classification** (MUST pick one):
  - **Low**: Localized, non-breaking changes
  - **Moderate**: Shared module / light interface changes  
  - **High**: Public API change / performance / security / migration
- **Rollback Strategy**: `revert commit <SHA>` or feature toggle reference

## Commit & DCO Policy

Commit format (MUST):
```
{{TYPE}}({{OPTIONAL_SCOPE}}): {{SUBJECT}} ({{ISSUE_KEY}})

Rationale (what & why).

Issue: {{ISSUE_KEY or none}}
Signed-off-by: {{Full Name}} <{{email@domain}}>
```

**Missing sign-off → block and request name/email.**

## Testing & Coverage

**Changed Logic → Test Assertions Mapping** (MUST):

| File | Method/Block | Change Type | Test File | Assertion Reference |
|------|--------------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| | | | | |

**Coverage Threshold** (MUST): ≥80% changed lines. If below: add tests or refactor for testability.

**Edge Cases** (MUST enumerate for each plan):
- Large input / boundary size
- Empty / nil input  
- Invalid / malformed data
- Platform-specific differences (Windows/Linux behavior)
- Concurrency / timing issues
- External dependency failures (Windows API calls)

**Test Execution**:
```bash
# Run all tests
rake test

# Run specific test file
ruby test/test_win32_mutex.rb

# Run with coverage (if simplecov is available)
COVERAGE=true rake test
```

## CI / Release Automation Integration

**GitHub Actions Workflows**:
- `ci-main-pull-request-checks.yml`: Main PR validation pipeline with complexity checks, TruffleHog scanning, and SBOM generation
- `lint.yml`: Ruby code linting with RuboCop
- `unit.yml`: Unit test execution

**Chef Expeditor Release Automation**:
- Automated version bumping based on PR labels
- Changelog generation and maintenance
- RubyGems publication upon release
- Branch cleanup after merge
- Slack notifications for build failures

**Version Bump Mechanism**: Expeditor automatically bumps version based on labels:
- `Expeditor: Bump Version Minor` for feature additions
- Default patch version bump for other changes
- Manual major version bumps for breaking changes

**AI MUST NOT directly edit release automation configs without explicit user instruction.**

## Security & Protected Files

**Protected** (NEVER edit without explicit approval):
- `LICENSE`
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT*`
- `CODEOWNERS`
- `SECURITY*`
- `.expeditor/config.yml` (release automation)
- `.github/workflows/*.yml` (CI workflow files)
- Secrets or credential placeholders
- Compliance policy docs

**NEVER**:
- Exfiltrate or inject secrets
- Force-push default branch
- Merge PR autonomously
- Insert new binaries
- Remove license headers
- Fabricate issue or label data
- Reference `~/.profile` in auth guidance

## Prompts Pattern (Interaction Model)

After each step AI MUST output:

```
Step: {{STEP_NAME}}
Summary: {{CONCISE_OUTCOME}}
Checklist: 
- [x] {{COMPLETED_PHASE}}
- [ ] {{PENDING_PHASE}}
Prompt: "Continue to next step? (yes/no)"
```

Non-affirmative response → AI MUST pause & clarify.

## Validation & Exit Criteria

Task is **COMPLETE ONLY IF**:

1. Feature/fix branch exists & pushed
2. RuboCop linting passes
3. Tests pass (including platform-specific tests if applicable)
4. Coverage mapping complete + ≥80% changed lines
5. PR open (draft or ready) with required sections
6. Appropriate labels applied
7. All commits DCO-compliant
8. No unauthorized Protected File modifications
9. User explicitly confirms completion

Otherwise AI MUST list unmet items.

Acceptance Criteria:
- ...

Implementation Plan:
- Goal:
- Impacted Files:
- Public API Changes:
- Data/Integration Considerations:
- Test Strategy:
- Edge Cases:
- Risks & Mitigations:
- Rollback:

Proceed? (yes/no)
```

## PR Description Canonical Template

Since `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` exists, AI MUST use that template structure and inject additional required sections:

**Existing Template Structure**:
```markdown
### Description
[Please describe what this change achieves]

### Issues Resolved
[List any existing issues this PR resolves, or any Discourse or StackOverflow discussion that's relevant]

### Check List
- [ ] New functionality includes tests
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] All commits have been signed-off for the Developer Certificate of Origin
```

**Required Additional Sections to Inject**:
```markdown
### Tests & Coverage
Changed lines: N; Estimated covered: ~X%; Mapping complete.

### Risk & Mitigations
Risk: Low | Mitigation: revert commit SHA

### DCO
All commits signed off.
```

## Idempotency Rules

**Re-entry Detection Order** (MUST):
1. Branch existence (`git rev-parse --verify <branch>`)
2. PR existence (`gh pr list --head <branch>`)
3. Uncommitted changes (`git status --porcelain`)

**Delta Summary** (MUST):
- Added Sections:
- Modified Sections:
- Deprecated Sections:
- Rationale:

## Failure Handling

**Decision Tree** (MUST):
- Labels fetch fails → Abort; prompt: "Provide label list manually or fix auth. Retry? (yes/no)"
- Issue fetch incomplete → Ask: "Missing acceptance criteria—provide or proceed with inferred? (provide/proceed)"
- Coverage < threshold → Add tests; re-run; block commit until satisfied
- Missing DCO → Request user name/email
- Protected file modification attempt → Reject & restate policy

## Glossary

- **Changed Lines Coverage**: Portion of modified lines executed by assertions
- **Implementation Plan Freeze Point**: No code changes allowed until approval
- **Protected Files**: Policy-restricted assets requiring explicit user authorization
- **Idempotent Re-entry**: Resuming workflow without duplicated or conflicting state
- **Risk Classification**: Qualitative impact tier (Low/Moderate/High)
- **Rollback Strategy**: Concrete reversal action (revert commit / disable feature)
- **DCO**: Developer Certificate of Origin sign-off confirming contribution rights
